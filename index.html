                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) are grounded in the belief that educators 
                        can better meet the needs of all students when they work together intentionally 
                        and systematically. At their core, PLCs focus on shared responsibility for 
                        student learning, continuous improvement, and collective inquiry. Effective PLCs 
                        are built on a foundation of trust, clarity of purpose, and a commitment to using 
                        evidence to inform practice. Through structured collaboration, educators reflect on 
                        teaching, analyze student data, and develop strategies to enhance outcomes. When 
                        implemented with fidelity, PLCs shift the culture of a school from isolated practice 
                        to a collaborative, student-centered environment where learning is at the heart of 
                        everything.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Transforming how science is taught means more than just updating lesson plans, it 
                        requires a fundamental shift in mindset. Helping educators move from traditional, 
                        content-heavy instruction to more modern, inquiry-driven practices is essential to 
                        creating a classroom culture that reflects the evolving nature of science itself. 
                        With a focus on equipping teachers with a clear understanding of why change is 
                        necessary, grounding the shift in real-world relevance, scientific literacy, and 
                        the skills students need to navigate a rapidly advancing, data-rich world. Done 
                        effectively, educators can embrace innovation and curiosity, inspire the next 
                        generation of thinkers, problem-solvers, and lifelong learners.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This support helps districts build a clear, connected approach to K-8 science by 
                        deeply integrating the expectations of the NGSS. Whether by leveraging high-quality 
                        instructional materials or empowering teachers to design three-dimensional lessons, 
                        the goal is to ensure all students engage in coherent, rigorous science learning 
                        and meaningful sensemaking. This offering can be adapted for both standards-based 
                        systems and traditional frameworks, meeting schools where they are while guiding 
                        them toward stronger instructional alignment.

                        Successful OpenSciEd implementation begins with a strong understanding of its design, 
                        instructional routines, and emphasis on student-driven sensemaking. Educators learn 
                        how to use the open-source curriculum effectively while also integrating meaningful 
                        assessments tailored to district needs, all aligned with NGSS and supporting 
                        three-dimensional learning. This offering builds teacher capacity and ensures 
                        coherent, high-quality science instruction across K-8.

                        Discover whether current science assessments truly embody the three dimensions of NGSS and 
                        transform them (or design new tasks) that anchor learning in novel phenomena and authentic 
                        sense-making. The focus is on ensuring that assessments are centered around more than content, 
                        allowing students to engage in scientific practices and authentic thinking. These assessments 
                        not only enhance student learning but also prepare them for the Illinois Science Assessment, 
                        now a vital 5% of a district's report card score. With the right tools and design, 
                        assessments become more than a measure, they become a meaningful part of how students engage 
                        with and understand the world, while also providing valuable data to inform instructional 
                        decisions about student growth in skills, knowledge, and scientific thinking.

                        for multilingual learners. In a recent partner school, this approach led to a 24% increase in

                        Engineering is more than just “using the SEPs”, it's an essential dimension of science 
                        learning. In this session, learn how to embed STEM and engineering meaningfully into your 
                        existing science instruction to bring the Engineering, Technology, and Applications of 
                        Science (ETS) standards to life. We'll explore how to design instruction that integrates 
                        authentic engineering challenges with science content, while actively engaging students in 
                        the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). Walk away with tools, strategies, and examples 
                        that make engineering a natural and powerful part of your science classroom, not an add-on.

                I'm a passionate educator who believes all students deserve 
                learning experiences that are meaningful. Over the past 20 years, 
                I've worn many hats, yet in every role, I've stayed focused on what 
                matters most: helping students think deeply, wonder freely, and 
                feel seen in their learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know how challenging and rewarding this work can be. That's why 
                I partner with schools and educators to design practical, engaging, 
                and inclusive solutions; whether that means reimagining curriculum, 
                strengthening PLC practices, or leading transformative professional 
                learning. My style is collaborative, responsive, and grounded in the 
                realities of the classroom. Together, we can create learning 
                experiences that are not only rigorous but also joyful.

                Without Nicole, my entire grade-level-team's lessons - especially in science - 
                would not be as engaging, reflective, or impactful as they are. Her flexibility, 
                willingness to collaborate, and depth of knowledge on professional development and 
                teaching strategies, has further advanced our instruction and the learning for all 
                of our students.

                Nicole is a dynamic speaker and presenter who engages staff in applicable 
                professional learning. Our PD space was transformed into a classroom as Nicole led 
                teachers through exercises that mimicked how students who speak other languages 
                feel while learning science in our schools. Teachers left with actionable ways to 
                scaffold science education as well as an understanding of our district's data 
                regarding English learners.

                <span>Working with Nicole for the past 6 years was an exceptional experience. Her creativity, 
                intelligence, and deep knowledge of science education consistently brought fresh perspectives 
                to our work. Whether we were designing curriculum, integrating inquiry-based learning, or 
                aligning instruction with current NGSS standards, Nicole offered ideas that were both 
                cutting-edge and innovative.</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>What stood out most is her genuine passion for science, not just as a subject, but as a 
                way of thinking and exploring the world. That enthusiasm reignited my own excitement for 
                teaching and learning. Through our collaboration, I not only enhanced my instructional 
                strategies but also grew significantly as a reflective educator.</span><br>
                <br>
                <span>Nicole is more than a consultant; she is a mentor and thought partner who brings insight, 
                integrity, and inspiration to every conversation. I recommend her without hesitation to any 
                individual or organization seeking support in science education or broader educational growth.</span>
