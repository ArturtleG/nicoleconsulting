                        I help schools unlock the power of equity and creativity in education. 
                        With decades of experience as a science teacher and coach, I partner with 
                        educators to build joyful, inclusive, and engaging learning spaces. Whether 
                        you're rethinking your curriculum, leading professional learning, or transforming 
                        school culture, I'm here to help.

                I am a passionate educator with a deep commitment to equity and creativity in education. 
                My journey has taken me from the classroom to coaching, and now I am dedicated to partnering 
                with schools to create inclusive and engaging learning environments.

                <p>
                With a background in science education and years of experience, I understand the challenges 
                educators face. I believe that every student deserves access to high-quality education 
                that inspires curiosity and fosters a love for learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                My approach is rooted in collaboration, creativity, and a commitment to equity. I work closely 
                with educators to develop tailored solutions that meet the unique needs of their students and 
                communities.
                Together, we can create learning experiences that are not only rigorous but also joyful and
                inclusive.
                </p>
                <p>

                The Evolution of Learning is a transformative approach to education that emphasizes 
                the importance of equity and creativity in the classroom. It is a journey that 
                reimagines traditional teaching methods and embraces innovative practices that 
                engage students and foster a love for learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                This approach recognizes that every student is unique and brings their own experiences, 
                strengths, and challenges to the learning environment. By creating inclusive and 
                engaging spaces, we can empower students to take ownership of their learning and 
                develop critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout their lives.
